# Cryptography
Design and Implementation of RSA Cryptosystem.<br /><br /> Hahsed the given list of passwords with SHA256 and compare it with the encrypted passwords.<br /><br /> Use formula c ≡ m^e mod N to encrypt c where m is the message and (N, e) is a combination of public key.<br /><br /> In order to decrypt the message, the formula that has been used was m ≡ c^d mod N where d is the private key.<br /><br /> Found vulnerability in key generation cause same RNG(random number generator) is used for all public keys. Also able to fetch my own unique private key.<br /><br /> Used Chinese Remainder Theorem in order to decrypt 3 different messages that were encrypted by 3 different RSA public keys. I didnt use the decryption formula (m ≡ c^d mod N) because d (private key) was not given, otherwise it would have been much easier.
